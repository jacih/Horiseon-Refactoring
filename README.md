# Horiseon-Refactoring Assignment

## Overview
Two important factors in website development for any business are ensuring web accessibility and legibility of the html file and the cascading style sheets.

Accessibility creates a broader userbase by enabling assistive technologies so that users with disabilities may have equal access to website content. While making your business' website more user-friendly, increasing the web accessibility of your site also helps avoid litigation as, as of January 1, 2021, the AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) mandated that all public and private sector businesses with 50+ employees must make web content accessible WCAG 2.0 AA standards.
For more information on AODA compliance please refer to [https://www.aoda.ca/new-aoda-requirement-for-ontario-websites/](https://www.aoda.ca/new-aoda-requirement-for-ontario-websites/).

Legibility and organization of a website's code is important in ensuring the efficiency at which other developers may review and update content, functionality and/or fix bugs as needed.

In order to ensure Horiseon's website was both more accessible and their code was more legible and organized a site audit was performed and revisions were made to both the index.html file, as well as the css file.

## Revisions
Revisions to the html file include:
- updating the webpage's title to be more descriptive.
- fixing the broken "Search Engine Optimization" hyper-link in the navigation bar.
- adding more descriptive tags for organization of the html elements.
- adding section comments above each of the 5 main sections of the body of the webpage.
- adding alt tags to all images.
- adding an aria tag to the background image.

Revisions to the css file include:
- updating universal selector to include default font-size and font-color.
- updated "SEO" font-color in header to create higher contrast ratio.*
- updated header background colour to create higher contrast ratio.*
- updating selectors to reflect html tag revisions.
- consolidating repetitive class selectors in the <main> and <aside> sections.
- consolidating repetitive html element selectors in the above sections.
- revised .sidebar height dimension to ensure background extended the length of the copy.
- added footer font-color to over-ride universal font-color addition.
    
* Color changes for accessibility may break brand guidelines and need to be approved by the business prior to implementation as the proposed revision may create a snowball effect. If a color being used presents accessibility issues, the developer should flag the issue to the design firm and/or company and should not move forward with their own adjustment.
