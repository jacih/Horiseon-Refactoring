        <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, 
            whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. 
            They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development 
            of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat 
            and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop 
            in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to 
            psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, 
            the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as 
            leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.
